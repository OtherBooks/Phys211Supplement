\begin{problem}{3.0}{cycle}{18}
Consider an ideal gas of diatomic molecules.  The gas contains 
$\frac{1}{60} \units{mol}$ and starts at point {\bf A} in the diagram
with a temperature $T_A = 449^\circ\units{C}$.   The gas expands 
along the path {\bf A}$\longrightarrow${\bf B} with no heat flowing into 
or out of the gas; during this expansion, $76.9\units{J}$ of work is done 
{\bf by} the gas. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the temperature of the gas at point {\bf B} after 
the expansion.
\item \mbox{Determine the net work done {\bf by} the gas in one complete cycle 
({\bf A}$\longrightarrow${\bf B}$\longrightarrow${\bf C}
$\longrightarrow{\bf A}$)}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
