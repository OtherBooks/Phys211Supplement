\chapter{Gas Processes}
\label{chapter:gas_processes}

There are a lot of very useful and important things that can be done
with gases. Burning gases in an internal combustion engine can power
a car.  Boiling water (and its vapor) can turn a turbine in an electrical
power generation plant. Expanding lungs enable your body to draw in air
and extract oxygen to enable you to live.  Vaporization of methylene
chloride and water allows a dunking bird to bob up and down indefinitely
over your glass of water in your dorm room.  Numerous gas processes in
the atmosphere drive the weather system on the Earth.  Expanding and
contracting gaseous bladders enable fish to swim without sinking or
floating to the surface.  Adiabatic heating of a collapsing cloud of
hydrogen in space provides the spark that triggers nuclear fusion and
enables the birth of stars (including our Sun). Hot gases shooting
out of an engine can power an airplane or a rocket.  And just about
every chemical reaction can be thought of as a thermodynamic process,
so an understanding of this topic is critical for the entire field of
chemistry and, by extension, biochemistry, biology and bioengineering.

These are just a small sample of the ways in which thermodynamic
processes play a critical role in practical applications and in the basic
functioning of the universe as we know it.  In all of these cases, it
is critical to understand several things:  (1) how much work is required
to perform the process or, alternately, how much work is produced by the
process; (2) how much energy in the form of heat must be added to the gas
(or released from the gas) during the process; and (3) how the internal
energy of the gas either increases or decreases during the process.
From this perspective, by far the most important mathematical relation
required for analyzing gas processes is one that we have already seen:
the First Law of Thermodynamics (Eq.~\ref{eq:firstlaw}) 

\begin{center}
% \boxittext{$\Delta E_\text{therm} = Q_\text{in} + W_\text{on}$}. 
$\Delta E_\text{therm} = Q_\text{in} + W_\text{on}$. 
\end{center}

In this chapter, we will discuss in detail how we can calculate the work, heat and internal energy changes that occur in thermodynamic processes.

\section{P-V diagrams}

An important tool used in analysis of thermodynamics processes is a
plot of pressure versus the volume of a gas, referred to in short as a
{\em P-V diagram}. These diagrams are very useful first because they are
directly related to the work done on or by a gas and second because they
are very convenient for showing the time evolution of a thermodynamic
process, particularly {\em cyclic} processes that repeat over and over
again, as is the case with many engineering systems.

A dot on a PV diagram provides a partial representation of the state of
a gaseous system. In general, the pressure $P$, volume $V$, temperature
$T$, number of moles $n$ and the entropy $S$ (which will be  introduced
in the next chapter) are all considered to be {\em state variables}
for a gas -- if you can specify all of these, then you know the state
of a gas at a particular moment in time. But displaying all of these
quantities at the same time graphically would be too cumbersome, since
we tend to view things best on a two-dimensional piece of paper (or the
screen of your smart phone).  Pressure and volume are chosen as the two
state variables that plotted directly, although we can use the ideal
gas law to infer information about the temperature as well.

A changing volume or pressure results in a curve on a PV-diagram.
Figure {\bf BLA} shows a few different processes.  Figure BLA(a) shows a
constant pressure process, with an arrow that indicates an increasing
volume (expansion).  If the arrow were turned around, the same graph
would show a constant pressure compression. In the literature, you may
see a constant pressure process referred to as an {\em isobaric} process
(``iso'' meaning ``same'' and ``baric'' meaning ``pressure'').
Figure BLA(b) shows a constant volume process, with an arrow that
indicates an increasing pressure.  (There is no fancy ``iso'' term
that is used for constant volume processes.)

Figure BLA(c) shows a few constant temperature ({\em isothermal})
processes. Assuming the number of moles of the gas doesn't change during
a process, the ideal gas law can be used to determine the relationship
between the pressure $P$ and volume $V$ for  an isothermal process:
$PV = nRT \rightarrow P = (nRT)\frac{1}{V}$
The result is a swoopy curve (yes, ``swoopy'' is a valid scientific
expression) since the pressure depends inversely on the volume if $n$
and $T$ are constant. The resulting curve on a PV-diagram is referred
to as an ``isotherm'' and the same graph can show several different
isotherms, depending on the magnitude of the temperature.  Figure BLA(c)
shows that the isotherms correspond to higher temperatures are higher and
to the right on a PV diagram. It can also be seen that either a constant
volume increase in pressure or an isobaric expansion result in a larger
temperature (indicated by moving to a hotter isotherm).  These results,
of course, are both consistent with the ideal gas law.

\section{Calculating work done in gas processes}

Okay, we now have the tools to enable us to calculate the work done on
or by a gas during a process.  The key is the volume.  It turns out that
an expanding gas does work on its environment, whereas it is necessary
for an external agent to do work on a gas for it to be compressed.
This can be understood qualitatively by considering a balloon.  If you
want to compress the gas on a balloon, you have to squeeze the balloon,
doing work on the gas.  But if you stick a pin in the balloon, it will pop
and do work on the environment, as evidenced both by the loud ``POP!''
sound and the pieces of balloon fabric that go flying all over the place
after the explosion.

Quantitatively, the work done in an expansion or compression process can
be analyzed as a P-V process. For simplicity, let's consider a cylinder
with a fitted piston with mass $m$ that seals in the gas but which can
slide up and down without friction (Figure BLA).

The work done on the piston by the gas inside the cylinder 
\footnote{Note of course that the gas in the cylinder isn't the only
thing doing work on the piston in this example:  gravity also does work,
as does the gas {\em outside} the cylinder, along with any friction or
air resistance.}
can be calculated from the standard relation for the work done by
a spatially-varying force:  
$W_{by}=\int{F_{gas}dx}$.  Since the pressure $P$ is the force
divided by the surface area, $F_{gas} = P_{gas}A$ where $A$ is the
cross-sectional area of the piston.  Consequently, $W_{by} =  \int{PAdx} 
=  \int{PdV}$ where we are dropping the ``gas'' subscripts. This result deserves its own line and an equation number:
\begin{equation}
W_{by} = \int PdV
\label{eq:WorkBy}
\end{equation}
So, the work done by the gas is simply the integral of the pressure,
integrated over the volume.  And the work done {\em on} a gas is just the
opposite:  
\begin{equation}
W_{on} = -\int PdV
\label{eq:WorkOn}
\end{equation}
Note also that we can also calculate the work
by determining the area under a curve of P versus V, i.e., the area in a
P-V diagram.  Here is another example of how useful P-V diagrams can be,
since they display quite directly the work done on or by a gas process.


{\bf NOTE:} the sign of the work is critically important.  There is a big
difference between a positive and a negative value for, e.g., the work
done by a process $W_{by}$. For a car engine, for example, a positive
value of $W_{by}$ means that the car is able to drive, whereas a negative
value for $W_{by}$ means that you have to push the car to get it to go.

Special cases:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Constant volume processes}.  If the volume remains constant during a
process, the work done on and by the gas is zero.

\item {\bf Isobaric (constant pressure) processes}. In this case, the work done
by the gas $W_{by} = \int_{V_1}^{V_2}PdV = P\int_{V_1}^{V_2}dV = P\Delta V$.  
So, the work
done {\bf on} the gas $W_{on} = -W_{by} = -P\Delta V$.  This can also been
seen easily from a P-V diagram for an isobaric process (Fig. BLA):  the
area under the curve is simply the area of the rectangle $P\Delta V$.

\item {\bf Isothermal (constant temperature) processes}. In this case, the work
done by the gas $W_{by} = \int_{V_1}^{V_2}PdV = \int_{V_1}^{V_2}nRT\frac{1}{V}dV
 = nRT\int_{V_1}^{V_2}\frac{1}{V} dV = nRT[\text{ln}(V)]_{V_1}^{V2}
= nRT(\text{ln}(V_2)-\text{ln}(V_1)) = nRT\text{ln}(V_2/V_1)$. And, of course, the work
done {\bf on} the gas $W_{on} = -W_{by} = -nRT\text{ln}(V_2/V_1)$.

{\bf Useful trick:} note that since the ideal gas law states that $PV = nRT$, the work done by 
a gas during an isothermal process can also be written as $W_{by}
= PV\text{ln}(V_2/V_1)$. This is really useful if you know the pressure
and volume at any moment during the isothermal process but don't know
the temperature.

\item {\bf Straight-line processes on a P-V diagram}. In these cases, the work
can be determined by determining the area under the curve.

\end{itemize}

If you can't figure it out from any of the four approaches, there is
one other way in which you will be able to calculate the work done on
or by a gas during a processes: use the First Law of Thermodynamics.
If you have a process where you can determine the heat flowing in $Q_{in}$
and the change in the internal energy $\Delta E_{therm}$, then you will be able
to find $W_{on} = \Delta E_{therm} - Q_{in}$.

\begin{example}{BLA}
EXAMPLE
\end{example}

\section{Adiabatic processes}

In many real gas processes, there is no heat flow either into or out of
the system; i.e., $Q_{in} = 0$. This occurs if (a) the system is completely
isolated from its environment (so there is no way for heat to be exchanged
with its surroundings); (b) if the system is well-insulated to prevent
the flow of heat in or out (e.g., if wrapped in insulating foam); or 
(c) if the processes occurs so rapidly that they simply isn't enough time for
there to be an appreciable flow of heat into or out of the system.

A process with no heat flow (i.e., $Q_{in} = 0$) is referred to as an
{\em adiabatic} process. The calculations of $Q_{in}$, $W_{on}$ and
$\Delta E_{therm}$ are easier for adiabatic processes, predominately because
$Q_{in} = 0$ (by definition), so if you can determine one of either
$W_{on}$ or $\Delta E_{therm}$, you can get the other from the First
Law of Thermodynamics.
Calculating $W_{on}$ is non-trivial for an adiabatic process (it isn't
one of the four special cases discussed in the previous section), so
for an adiabatic process, we will typically find $\Delta E_therm$  first.
We'll discuss how to do that in the next section. 

First, however, we
can quickly get an idea of how an adiabatic process looks on a P-V
diagram. Since $Q_{in} = 0$ for an adiabatic process, the First Law
becomes:  $\Delta E_{therm} = W_{on}$; i.e., any work done on the system
goes into increasing the internal energy.  And recall that the thermal
energy of a gas increases with the temperature of the gas.
So, an adiabatic compression, for example, will have $W_{on} > 0$
which means that $\Delta E_{therm} > 0$.  This means that for any
adiabatic compression, the gas heats up (i.e., the temperature increases).
This makes sense:  we are doing work on the gas to compress it, and that
work goes into heating up the gas and increasing the temperature.

FIGURE SHOWING BOTH ADIABITIC AND ISOTHERMAL PROCESSES ON P-V DIAGRAM.

Since an adiabatic compression results in an increase in temperature,
the curve on a P-V diagram for an adiabatic compression must go to larger
and larger temperature, which means that and adiabatic process is
associated with a curve (an ``adiabat'') that is steeper than those for
isothermal processes (i.e., ``isotherms''). This can be seen in Fig.
BLA which shows curves for both adiabatic and isothermal processes.

To make a quantitative statement about the functional form of the
adiabatic curves, we need to consider the type of gas. 
As discussed in section \ref{section:TheGasState}, the thermal energy
of a gas depends on the type of molecules in that gas.  (See 
Eqs.~\ref{eq:monatomic_ideal_gas}, \ref{eq:diatomic_ideal_gas} and 
\ref{eq:EthermIdealGas}.)

Eq.~\ref{eq:EthermIdealGas}

Which brings us
to a discussion of ...

\section{Monatomic and diatomic gases}

The thermodynamic behavior of a gas depends critically on the type
of molecule that makes up the gas.  Different types of molecules have
different ways of storing internal energy in a gas. For a
monatomic gas -- i.e., a gas composed of monatomic molecules (those with
just one atom, such as helium gas) -- the only kind of thermal
energy is that associated with translational kinetic energy of the
atoms; i.e., 
\begin{equation}
E_{molecule}^{monatomic} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 
= \frac{1}{2}mv_x^2  + \frac{1}{2}mv_y^2  + \frac{1}{2}mv_z^2.  
\label{eq:monatomic}
\end{equation}

A {\em diatomic} gas (i.e., one composed of molecules with two atoms,
such as nitrogen -- $N_2$ -- or oxygen -- $O_2$) has several forms of
internal energy.  In addition to translation kinetic energy, a diatomic
molecule can also have energy associated with {\em rotations}.
We will be covering rotations later in the semester, but there is
a kinetic energy $\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$ associated with rotation.
For a diatomic molecule, there are two axes around which it can
rotate with a non-zero rotational kinetic energy, so
\begin{equation}
E_{molecule}^{diatomic}  
= \frac{1}{2}mv_x^2  + \frac{1}{2}mv_y^2  + \frac{1}{2}mv_z^2  
+ \frac{1}{2}I_1\omega_1^2  + \frac{1}{2}I_2\omega_2^2,
\label{eq:diatomic}
\end{equation}
where $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are {\em angular velocities} associated
with rotation.  Don't worry about the details here -- since we haven't
covered rotations yet, we don't expect y'all to follow the details here.
But you don't really have to understand the details; all that you need
to recognize here is that whereas a monatomic gas has three quadratic terms
associated with thermal energy, a diatomic gas has five quadratic terms. 
We refer to these as {\em degrees of freedom} $f$ where $f = 3$ for a monatomic
gas and $f = 5$ for a diatomic gas.

(Actually, a diatomic gas has more degrees of freedom if hot enough. Thermal
energy for a diatomic gas can also include two additional terms for
potential energy for vibrations, in which case $f = 7$.  Because of
quantum effects (which isn't discussed until PHYS 212), these vibrational
states don't affect the behavior of the gas unless it is quite hot, so
we will often ignore the vibrational degress of freedom.)

We are now ready to calculate $\Delta E_{therm}$ for gas processes.  The
only thing that we need is the Equipartition Theorem which says that we can 
replace each of the terms in Eqs.~\ref{eq:monatomic} and \ref{eq:diatomic}
with $\frac{1}{2}k_BT^2$, and then multiply by the number $N$ of gas molecules.  So,
\begin{equation}
E_{therm}^{monatomic} = 3\times N\times\frac{1}{2}k_BTi = \frac{3}{2}nRT
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
E_{therm}^{diatomic} = 5\times N\times\frac{1}{2}k_BT = \frac{5}{2}nRT.
\end{equation}
More generally, for a gas composed of molecules with $f$ degrees of freedom
\begin{equation}
E_{therm} = \frac{f}{2}Nk_BT = \frac{f}{2}nRT.
\label{eq:DeltaETherm}
\end{equation}
So, if you know how many degrees of freedom the gas molecules have
(or if you are told it is a monatomic gas -- $f = 3$ -- or a cold
diatomic gas -- $f = 5$), you can determine $\Delta E_{therm}$ from
Eq.~\ref{eq:DeltaETherm}; i.e., $\Delta E_{therm} = \frac{f}{2}nR\Delta T$.

{\bf Useful trick redux:} the same $PV = nRT$ trick can be used here.
If you don't know the temperature but you do know the initial and
final pressure and volume, then $\Delta E_{therm} = \frac{f}{2}(P_2V_2
- P_1V_1)$.
