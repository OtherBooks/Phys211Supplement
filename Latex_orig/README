* Made separate directories for each chapter, which included changing
  the \includegraphics commands

* defined "problem" and "aproblem" environments and recast all
  problems in terms of these

* brought in amsmath package to allow for using "align" rather than
  "eqnarray".

* defined "objectives" environment for the objectives enumerated list
  and the beginning of each chapter - this was the counter for the
  standard "enumerate" environment doesn't have to be re-defined


2 July 2008 - Ben

* Pushed local definitions and environments to "supplement.sty"

* Redefined the "example" environment to simplify usage and provide 
  some indentation.  Usage:

  \begin{example}{Title of example}
  Text of example question.
  \solution 
  Solution of example question.
  \end{example}

* Switched from obsolete caption2 to caption package, removed "hang"
  and added small indentation to both sides.

* Removed \pagestyle and \newpage commands.  This simplifies the
  source files and avoids the possibility of accidental blank pages.
  This also means that blank pages at the end of chapters now have a
  header, but this seems like a minor cost.

* Related: moved the \markboth and \markright header formatting
  commands into the relevant chapters.  Switched to \markright for the
  Problems section, to be more consistent with previous chapter
  sections.

* Moved title page and copyright page to external files: title.tex and
  copyright.tex

* Put the A-problem counter definition within the additional problems
  file.

* Experimenting with problem environment.
