\section{Introduction}

In our everyday lives we experience many examples where mechanical
energy is not conserved: brakes slow down a car, a bouncing superball
returns to a lower height than it started from, and blow darts slide
to a stop along the corridors of Bucknell residence halls.  Because
friction takes mechanical energy away from an object, historically
it was not at all obvious that energy should be conserved.
But some physicists in the 19th century noticed that when friction
acts to slow an object and take away some mechanical energy, the
object invariably becomes hotter.  This suggested that temperature is
connected to some kind of internal energy of the object --- let's call
it {\it thermal energy} --- and that friction has acted to convert
some of the object's mechanical energy to this thermal energy.
Careful experiments by Joule and others confirmed the hypothesis that
total energy is conserved even when mechanical energy is gained or
lost, and now energy conservation is one of the most fundamental
principles in physics.

But what is thermal energy?  As we shall see, it is nothing more than
the kinetic and potential energy of the individual molecules that make
up the objects in our everyday world.  In this unit we will begin by
distinguishing mechanical energy from thermal energy.

\section{Thermal Kinetic Energy}

\label{section:thermal_kinetic_energy}

First, let's consider molecular kinetic energy.  Consider a set of $N$
molecules, each with the same mass $m$, with velocities $\vec v_1$,
$\vec v_2$, \dots, $\vec v_N$.  We will show that the kinetic energy
associated with these moving molecules can be separated into
mechanical kinetic energy and thermal kinetic energy.  The first step
is to calculate the motion of what is called the {\it center of mass.}
At some particular instant in time, the positions of each particle are
given by the vectors $\vec r_1$, $\vec r_2$, \dots, $\vec r_N$.  The
location of the center of mass, denoted by the vector $\vec r_{cm}$,
is the average of these positions
\begin{equation}
\vec r_{cm} = \frac{1}{N}(\vec r_1 + \vec r_2 + \dots + \vec r_N).
\end{equation}
Taking a time derivative of this equation gives
\begin{equation}
\vec v_{cm} = \frac{d\vec r_{cm}}{dt} =
\frac{1}{N}(\vec v_1 + \vec v_2 + \dots + \vec v_N),
\end{equation}
so the center of mass velocity is simply the average velocity (in this
simplified case of equal masses).  

For a rigid object, like a solid, the velocity of the center of mass
is simply the velocity of the object.  If the center of mass velocity
of some object is zero, then that object, viewed macroscopically, is at
rest.  A ball sitting on a table has a stationary center of mass, and
therefore no mechanical kinetic energy.  However, the individual
molecules of the ball are certainly not at rest and do have kinetic
energy.  The motion appears random, with molecules moving in every
direction; some molecules moving faster and some slower.  It is this
molecular kinetic energy which we identify as thermal
energy.\footnote{For simplicity, we are excluding the possibility of
  rotations.}

\boxittext{The thermal kinetic energy of an object is simply the
  molecular kinetic energy when the center of mass is at
  rest.}

What about the case where the center of mass is moving?  For example,
if the ball is not sitting on the table but rather flying through the
air.  It is still possible to identify the thermal kinetic energy,
because there is always some co-moving reference frame in which the
ball is at rest.  The molecular motion as viewed in that
frame will again be the thermal kinetic energy.

But nevertheless we may ask if
it is possible to identify the thermal kinetic energy in a frame where
the ball is moving.  And indeed, it is possible.  The velocity $\vec
v_i$ of the $i$th molecule can be written as a sum of the center of
mass velocity $\vec v_{cm}$ and the velocity of the particle relative
to the center of mass $\vec v_{i,rel}$.  That is, $\vec v_i = \vec
v_{cm} + \vec v_{i,rel}$.  Then the total kinetic energy is the sum
over all particles:
\begin{align}
K_\text{total} &=
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}\sum_i m (\vec v_{cm}+\vec v_{i,rel})\cdot  
(\vec v_{cm}+\vec v_{i,rel}) \nonumber\\
&= {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}\sum_i m\, v_{cm}^2 
+\sum_i m\,\vec v_{cm}\cdot \vec v_{i,rel}
+ {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}\sum_i m\, v_{i,rel}^2.
\label{eq:kinetic_energy}
\end{align}
Note that $\vec v_{cm}$ is the same for all particles, so it can be
brought outside the sum over particles.  Then the first term becomes
\begin{equation}
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}\sum_i m\, v_{cm}^2  = {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}v_{cm}^2
\sum_i m = {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}Mv_{cm}^2,
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the total mass of all the particles.  This is exactly the
mechanical kinetic energy we have already encountered.  The second
term can be written as
\begin{equation}
m\vec v_{cm} \cdot \left( \sum \vec v_{i,rel}\right). 
\end{equation}
Since $\vec v_{i,rel}$ is the particle velocity relative to the center
of mass frame, the sum $\sum \vec v_{i,rel}=0$, and this term
vanishes.  The last term in Eq.~(\ref{eq:kinetic_energy}) is just the
total kinetic energy measured in a frame moving with the center of
mass, which is the thermal kinetic energy.  Putting this all together,
\begin{equation}
K = K_\text{mech} + K_\text{therm},
\end{equation}
thus the kinetic energy divides cleanly into mechanical and thermal
kinetic energy.

\section{Thermal Potential Energy}

\label{section:thermal_potential_energy}

Thermal energy is not just kinetic, but also involves potential
energy.  Mole\-cules exert forces on each other, pushing and
pulling.\footnote{The origin of these forces is the electric force
  interactions between the charges of the atoms combined with quantum
  mechanics, which governs the location of the charges.  Both of these
  topics will be covered in PHYS 212.}  These forces are conservative,
so there is a potential energy associated with each pair of molecules.
To understand this potential energy, we must first consider the force
between an isolated pair of molecules.  There are three distinct
regimes, depending on how far apart the two molecules are.
\begin{itemize}
\item When the molecules are closer than a molecular diameter, they
exert a strong repulsive force on each other.
\item When the molecules are within a few molecular diameters, they
exert attractive forces on each other.
\item When the molecules are more than a few molecular diameters away
from each other, the force becomes negligibly small.
\end{itemize}

This behavior is captured by what is called the {\it pair
  potential\/}, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pair_potential}, which is the
potential energy $U_\text{pair}(r)$ due to a pair of molecules
separated by a distance $r$.  The diagram illustrates the three
regions.  Notice that at a separation $r=d$, where $d$ is the
molecular diameter, there is an equilibrium point dividing the regions
of attractive and repulsive forces.

As we shall see in the next two chapters, this pair potential explains
the existence of solid, liquid, and gas phases, and many details of
the phases and of the transitions between the phases.  It is one of
the remarkable triumphs of the atomic theory of matter that so much
behavior can be explained by such a simple model of the forces between
atoms!

In principle, the {\it system} potential energy for a system of $N$
molecules contains the pair potential energy for every single pairing
of the molecules.  This is a very large number of pairs!  Fortunately,
only those molecules which are immediate neighbors are close enough to
have an appreciable force and potential energy, so we only need to
consider the potential energy due to neighboring molecules.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5in]{thermal_energy_and_solids/pair_potential.eps}
\caption{The pair potential energy $U_\text{pair}$ as a function of
  $r$, the separation between the pair of molecules.  The dashed lines
  separate the regions of repulsive force, attractive force, and
  negligible force.  At separation $r=d$ the pair is in equilibrium,
  which defines the molecular diameter.}
\label{fig:pair_potential}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

What about other sources of potential energy besides the
intermolecular forces?  For example, gravitational potential energy.
When a ball is thrown upwards, the gravitational potential energy of
each molecule increases.  But the height of each molecule is increased
by the same amount that the height of the center of mass is increased.
Therefore this change in potential energy has the form
\begin{equation}
\Delta U_\text{grav} = M_\text{object} g\Delta y_{cm},
\end{equation}
where $M_\text{object}$ is again the total mass of the object.  This
is the familiar mechanical potential energy.  Therefore, gravitational
potential energy is always part of the mechanical energy, whereas the
molecular interaction energy makes up the thermal potential energy.

In summary, here is the big picture for thermal energy:
\begin{itemize}
\item For both potential energy and kinetic energy, it is the
  `organized' motion that makes up the {\it mechanical energy}, such as
  all molecules increasing their height together or all molecules
  having a net alignment of their velocities.
\item The remaining disorganized motion, such as the wiggling of the
  mole\-cules and their individual pushes and pulls on each other,
  corresponds to the {\it thermal energy}.
\item Friction is an agent that takes organized motion and
  disorganizes it, taking away mechanical energy and increasing thermal
  energy.
\item Going the other way --- taking away thermal energy and
  increasing mechanical energy --- is more difficult, since molecules
  are not likely to spontaneously start moving together.
  Nevertheless, we can capture some amount of thermal energy and
  convert it to mechanical energy with a device called a heat engine,
  which is the topic of Supplementary Reading Chapter
  \ref{chapter:heat_engines}.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Solid State}

\label{section:the_solid_state}

Molecules interacting via the pair potential can be solids, liquids,
or gases.  The remainder of this chapter is concerned with the thermal
energy of the solid state, while liquid and gas states will be
presented in Chapter \ref{chapter:liquids_and_gases}.


Most inorganic solids are crystalline, which means the molecules are
arranged in a symmetric way, such as a cubic lattice.  (Organic
  solids instead are constructed from long carbon chains.)  In this
lattice, each pair of neighboring molecules is separated by roughly
the equilibrium distance, that is, the minimum of the pair potential
well, and only makes small excursions from this location.  As
illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:pair_potential_spring}, the pair
potential in this region is identical to a parabolic potential.  We
have previously encountered a parabolic potential energy curve as the
potential energy for a mass on a spring.  Evidently, as long as the
molecules in a solid are not deviating significantly from their
equilibrium position, we may regard their interactions with their
nearest neighbors as equivalent to being attached by a spring.

\boxittext{{\sc Checkpoint:} What is the main difference between the pair
  potential and the spring potential?  What would I need to do to a
  pair of molecules to see this difference?  (Push together?  Pull
  apart?  How far?) }

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{thermal_energy_and_solids/pair_potential_spring.eps}
\caption{The solid curve is the pair potential $U_\text{pair}$ as a
  function of separation $r$.  The dashed line is the spring potential
  $U_\text{spring}$ with the spring constant $k_{\text sp}$ chosen to match
  $U_\text{pair}$ near the minimum.  The inset shows the match.}
\label{fig:pair_potential_spring}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


This leads to what we call the {\it ideal solid}:
the molecules are balls of mass $m$, they are connected by springs of
spring constant $k_\text{sp}$, and the springs have an equilibrium length
of $d$.  This model is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:ball-spring}.  We
may think of the spring constant as determining the bond strength and
the equilibrium length $d$ as the bond length.  These three parameters
($m$, $d$, and $k_\text{sp}$) define the model, and we shall see that for
many solids determining these parameters describes much of the
behavior of the solid.

One may imagine packing the molecules together in different ways.  The
arrangement illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:ball-spring}, is called a
{\it simple cubic} lattice.  In fact, most solids are packed
differently, for example, in the way a grocer would stack oranges
(which is called a {\it face-centered cubic} lattice).  Fortunately,
this distinction has little impact on the quantities we will study, so
we will stick with the simple cubic lattice.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{thermal_energy_and_solids/ball-spring.eps}
\caption{The ball-spring model of a solid.}
\label{fig:ball-spring}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Given the properties of some solid, how are the ideal solid
parameters determined?  Let's derive these for a specific case, namely
copper.  Molecular properties, such as mass, are usually not specified
for a single molecule, but rather for a {\it mole}.  One mole equals
Avogadro's number
\begin{equation}
N_A=6.02\times 10^{23}
\end{equation} 
of molecules.  Avogadro's number is chosen so that roughly one mole of
protons has a mass of one gram.  The precise definition is that one
mole of carbon atoms has a mass of $12\units{g}$.  The mass of one mole
of a material would logically be called the molar mass, but instead it
is usually called the {\it molecular weight}.\footnote{It's not our fault.}

One mole of copper has mass $64\units{g}$, so we may conclude that a
single molecule of copper (the ball in our model) has mass
\begin{equation}
m_\text{Cu} = \frac{64\units{g}}{6.02\times 10^{23}} = 1.06\times
10^{-22}\units{g}.
\end{equation}
This is the first of our three parameters.

Next, we can get the equilibrium spacing $d$ between the molecules by
knowing the density of copper, which is $8.94\units{g/cm$^3$}$.  
In Fig.~\ref{fig:ball-spring-volume} shows that each molecule of copper
occupies its own cubical region with volume $d^3$.
We can relate the density $\rho$ of the solid to the mass per volume
of a unit cell.  That is,
\begin{equation}
\rho = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{m}{d^3} 
  \qquad \Rightarrow\qquad d =
\left(\frac{m}{\rho}\right)^{1/3}.
\end{equation}
For copper this gives
\begin{equation}
d_\text{Cu} = \left(\frac{m_\text{Cu}}{\rho_\text{Cu}}\right)^{1/3}
 =  \left(\frac{1.06\times
     10^{-22}\units{g}}{8.94\units{g/cm$^3$}}\right)^{1/3}
 = 2.28\times 10^{-8}\units{cm},
\end{equation}
or equivalently, $2.28\times 10^{-10}\units{m}$.
And so we have the second parameter.

%Next, we can get the equilibrium spacing between the molecules by
%knowing the density of copper, which is $8.94\units{g/cm$^3$}$.  How
%many copper molecules are in a cubic centimeter of copper?    We can 
%calculate this as follows:
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{8.94\units{g}}{64\units{g/mole}} = 0.139 \units{mol}
% = 8.41\times 10^{22} \units{molecules},
%\end{equation}
%where Avogadro's number was used to convert moles to molecules.  The
%cubic centimeter of volume is divided equally among this number of
%molecules so the volume per molecule is
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{1 \units{cm$^3$}}{8.41\times 10^{22}\units{molecules}}
% = 1.19\times 10^{-23}\units{cm$^3$}.
%\end{equation}
%
%The volume for a single molecule can be pictured as a cube of length
%$d$, where $d$ is the bond length (see
%Fig.~\ref{fig:ball-spring-volume}).  Since the volume of a cube is
%$V=d^3$, the bond length is obtained from $d=V^{1/3}$, or
%\begin{equation}
%d = (1.19\times 10^{-23}\units{cm$^3$})^{1/3} = 2.28\times 10^{-8}\units{cm}
% = 2.28\times 10^{-10}\units{m}.
%\end{equation}
%And so we have the second parameter.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{thermal_energy_and_solids/ball-spring-volume.eps}
\caption{For the ideal solid with a separation $d$ between the 
balls, the volume per ball is given by a cube of side $d$ (shown here
in two-dimensions).}
\label{fig:ball-spring-volume}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


The final step is to determine the spring constant.  Fortunately, it
is not necessary to try pulling on a single molecule and measuring the
force that it pulls back with.  Rather, a macroscopic chunk of
material can be fixed at one end and pulled on the other, and by
measuring how much the object stretches, the bond spring constant can
be measured.

Imagine a piece of copper wire with cross-sectional area $A$ and
length $L$.  The applied force required to stretch the wire by an amount
$\Delta L$ is given by the following relation:
\begin{equation}
F_\text{app} = \frac{Y A}{L}\Delta L.
\label{eq:force_extension}
\end{equation}
This relation indicates that the amount of stretch $\Delta L$ is
proportional to the amount of force applied; doubling the force will
double the amount of stretch from the equilibrium length.  A larger
cross-sectional area $A$ makes the wire harder to stretch, which
accounts for the factor of $A$ in the numerator.  The longer the wire,
the easier it is to stretch, accounting for the factor of $L$ in the
denominator.  The final parameter $Y$ is called Young's modulus,
and is a property of the material but not dependent on the geometry
of the wire.  For example, Young's modulus for copper is
$Y_\text{Cu} \approx 130\times 10^9 \units{N/m$^2$}$.  

\begin{example}{Stretching an Extension Cord}
Consider 16 gauge copper wire, commonly used in power cables, which 
has a
cross-sectional area of $1.3\times 10^{-6}\units{m$^2$}$.  How much
force is required to stretch a 2-meter length of wire a distance of
1 centimeter?
\solution
According to Eq.~(\ref{eq:force_extension}), the force is given by
\begin{align}
 F_\text{app} = \frac{Y_\text{Cu}A}{L}\Delta L &=
 \displaystyle\frac{(130\times 10^9\units{N/m$^2$})(1.3\times
  10^{-6}\units{m$^2$})} {2\units{m}} (0.01\units{m}) \nonumber\\
 &= 845\units{N}.
\end{align}
\end{example} 

Now we need to calculate Young's modulus for the ideal solid.
Consider a rectangular solid of $N_x \times N_y \times N_z$ molecules.
The object is stretched in the $z$-direction by an applied force $F$,
with a resulting stretch $\Delta L$.  The stretch is shared equally
among each of the $N_z$ springs aligned in the $z$-direction, so each
spring is stretched an amount $\Delta L/N_z$.  The plane of molecules
where the force is applied consists of $N_xN_y$ molecules, each
connected to a spring pulling with force $k_\text{sp}\Delta L/N_z$.  This
spring force is balancing the applied force, so we can conclude that
\begin{equation}
F_\text{app}= N_xN_y \left(\frac{k_\text{sp} \Delta L}{N_z}\right).
\end{equation}
If we multiply top and bottom by $d^2$ we can identify the
cross-sectional area $A=(N_x d)(N_y d)$, and the length $L=N_z d$:
\begin{equation}
F_\text{app}=\frac{d^2N_xN_y k_\text{sp}}{d^2 N_z} \Delta L 
                = \frac{k_\text{sp}}{d}
\frac{A}{L}\Delta L
\end{equation}
from which we conclude that Young's modulus for the ideal solid
is
\begin{equation}
Y=\frac{k_\text{sp}}{d}.
\end{equation}
This can be used to find the spring constant, $k_\text{sp} = Yd$.  For
example, for copper
\begin{equation}
k_\text{sp} = (130\times 10^9\units{N/m$^2$})(2.28\times 10^{-10}\units{m})
 = 29.6\units{N/m}.
\end{equation}
In this way, we can find all three ideal solid parameters from
knowing the molecular weight, the density, and Young's modulus.


\section{Speed of Sound}
\label{section:speedofsound}

How well does this ball-spring picture of a solid work? 
One way to test the model is to study the speed of sound in a
solid.  Sound is a compression wave, much like a compression pulse
sent down a stretched slinky.  If an ideal solid is suddenly
struck at one end, how fast does the compression wave travel toward
the other end?  We can almost guess the answer.  The wave ``hops''
from one molecule to its neighbor and each hop moves the wave a
distance $d$.  Since the molecules are harmonic oscillators, the time
it takes for a hop must be related to the period of oscillation $T$,
so we could guess $v_\text{sound} \approx d/T$.  It is not difficult
to do the full calculation for the ideal solid\footnote{This is
  done in PHYS 221/222.} and find that the answer differs from this
guess by a factor of $2\pi$:
\begin{equation}
v_\text{sound} = \frac{2\pi d}{T} = d\omega  = d\sqrt{\frac{k_\text{sp}}{m}}
\end{equation}
Thus, the speed of sound in the ideal solid depends on all three
parameters.  The values we obtained for copper (be careful to use SI
units here!) give
\begin{equation}
 v_\text{sound} = 2.28\times
 10^{-10}\units{m}\sqrt{\frac{29.6\units{N/m}}{1.06\times
     10^{-25}\units{kg}}} = 3810\units{m/s}
\end{equation}
which is exactly the measured value for the speed of sound in copper.
Evidently the ideal solid model works quite well.  You will make more
comparisons in the homework.

\section{Temperature}

We began the chapter mentioning that when mechanical energy gets
converted to thermal energy, the temperature increases.  But what is
temperature?  Everyone has an intuitive feel for it:  we know that a
high temperature corresponds to something that is ``hot'' and a low
temperature corresponds to something that is ``cold.''  We also know
from experience that ``heat'' --- which we will define shortly --- flows
from hot (high temperature) to cold (low temperature) objects.

It is common in many introductory text books to define temperature as
a measure of the average thermal kinetic energy $K_\text{therm}/N$ of
a material.\footnote{Historically, this approach was used successfully
  in the $18^\text{th}$ and $19^\text{th}$ centuries to develop the
  first successful quantitative theories of thermodynamics, referred
  to as the {\em kinetic theory} of thermodynamics.}  This definition of
temperature is not valid for all situations (we will provide a more
rigorous definition of temperature in Chapter
\ref{chapter:second_law}); however, there are many situations that can
benefit from simple view of temperature as a measure of thermal
kinetic energy.

We must talk about temperature units.  The Celsius
temperature scale is defined so that water freezes at a temperature of
$0^\circ\units{C}$ and water boils at $100^\circ\units{C}$.  Considering
temperature as a measure of kinetic energy, we can define {\em absolute
zero} as the temperature where all molecular motion stops.  This occurs at
$-273.15^\circ\units{C}$ in the Celsius scale.  

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{thermal_energy_and_solids/temperature_scales}
\caption{The size of the degree is the same for Celsius and Kelvin
  temperature scales.  They differ by a shift:  $T_K=T_C+273$}
\label{fig:temperature_scales}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

A important variation on the Celsius temperature scale is called the
Kelvin scale, illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:temperature_scales}.  The
``size'' of the degree is the same for Kelvin and Celsius, that is, a
change in temperature of $1\units{K}$ is the same as a change in
temperature of $1^\circ\units{C}$.  The boiling temperature of water
is still $100\units{K}$ higher than the freezing temperature. The
difference in the scales is the location of zero: in the Kelvin scale,
absolute zero corresponds to $0\units{K}$, water freezes at
$273\units{K}$ and boils at $373\units{K}$.  The Kelvin temperature
scale is the one best suited for most thermodynamics problems.


\section{Molar Specific Heat}

Now we are prepared to address the question, ``If a certain amount of
thermal energy is added to a system, how much will the temperature
increase?''  This is a question with far-reaching applications.  For
instance, how much energy needs to be added to a swimming pool to heat
it up to a comfortable temperature?  How much cooling water or antifreeze
is needed to keep a car from overheating?  How much will the temperature
of a bucket of water increase if a hot ingot of lead is tossed into it?

We mentioned in the previous section that temperature is often associated
with the thermal energy of a system, i.e., increases in temperature
are associated with increases in the thermal energy.  But {\em how much}
does the temperature increase with a certain amount of energy is
added to a material?  For that, we define the {\em molar specific heat}
$C$:
\begin{equation}
C = \frac{\Delta E_\text{therm}}{n \Delta T}.
\label{eq:specificheat}
\end{equation}
In words, the specific heat is defined as the energy required to
raise the temperature of one mole of a material by a temperature 1 K.
So, a material with a large specific heat requires a lot of heat to
increase its temperature significantly, whereas a material with a
small specific heat requires less energy to raise its temperature by the
same amount.

Turning Eq.~(\ref{eq:specificheat}) around, the energy
required to raise the temperature of a material is given by
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_\text{therm} = n C \Delta T.
\label{eq:Ethermspecificheat}
\end{equation}
Measurements have been made of the molar specific heat for a wide
variety of materials.  A few of these values are listed in 
Table~\ref{table:material_properties} for some common metals.  

Note that the relation between the thermal
energy and the temperature depends on the amount of material via the
number of moles $n$. Having more stuff
will require more thermal energy to get the same temperature change.
The molar specific heat $C$, however, is defined such that it
does {\it not} depend on the amount of material.

\newpage

\begin{example}{Temperature increases}
How much thermal energy must be added to $5.0\units{kg}$ of lead to
increase its temperature from $25^{\circ}\units{C}$ to $40^{\circ}\units{C}$?

\solution First, it is convenient to determine how many moles of lead
we have here.  From Table~\ref{table:material_properties}, we see that
the molar mass of lead is $207\units{g/mol}$, so the number of moles
is given by
\begin{equation*}
n = 5.0\units{kg} \cdot \frac{1000\units{g}}{\units{kg}} \cdot 
\frac{1\units{mol}}{207\units{g}} = 24.2\units{mol}
\end{equation*}
From Table~\ref{table:material_properties}, we see that
the molar specific heat of lead is 
$26.6\units{$\frac{\rm J}{\rm mol} \cdot {\rm K}$}$.
Using Eq.~(\ref{eq:Ethermspecificheat}), we find
\begin{equation*}
\Delta E_\text{therm} = n C \Delta T = 24.2\units{mol} \cdot
26.6\units{$\frac{\units{J}}{\units{mol} \cdot \units{K}}$} \cdot 15\units{K} = 9640\units{J}.
\end{equation*}
Note that the conversion between Celsius and Kelvin is trivial; a
temperature difference of $15^{\circ}\units{C}$ is the same as a
temperature difference of $15\units{K}$.
\end{example}

Looking at Table~\ref{table:material_properties}, it is apparent that
the molar specific heat for metals is fairly consistent --- around 
$25\units{J/mol$\cdot$K}$ --- for several common metals.  A pattern like this
indicates that there might be a simple, common explanation.  That
explanation is provided by the ideal solid model and what is known as the
equipartition theorem.

\section{The Equipartition Theorem}
\label{sec:equipartition}

We now discuss a remarkable relationship between temperature and
thermal energy, referred to as the {\em equipartition theorem}.  The
basic idea is that in thermodynamic systems, thermal energy is equally
(``equi'') divided (``partition'') between certain types of molecular
energy, both kinetic and potential.  At first glance, you might think
that this would mean that half of the energy is kinetic and half is
potential (and sometimes this is true), but it is not quite that simple.
For one, only those energy terms which are quadratic in a
dynamical variable (such as $\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2$) get the equal shares.
For any terms more complicated than that, like the pair potential, we
cannot so easily say how the energy is divided.  Also, the number of these
egalitarian quadratic energy terms, often called {\it degrees of freedom},
depends on details such as whether there is rotational as well as
translational kinetic energy.\footnote{For a solid the molecules
  essentially do not rotate, but rotational kinetic energy can have a
  significant effect on the thermal energy of a liquid or gas.}


% because (a) there are different types of kinetic
%energy, e.g., translation and rotational\footnote{For a solid the
%molecules essentially do not rotate, but rotational kinetic energy
%  can have a significant effect on the thermal energy of a liquid
%  or gas.} kinetic energy; (b) the partition of energy also depends on
%the number of {\em degrees of freedom} a system has, e.g., whether a
%molecule can oscillate only in one direction (1 degree of freedom),
%along a plane (2 degrees of freedom) or in any of the three dimensions
%(3 degrees of freedom); and (c) it only applies to {\em quadratic}
%degrees of freedom, meaning the energy term has to be proportional to
%the variable squared.

Maybe it will help to see the theorem:

\boxittext{{\sc Equipartition Theorem:}\\[0.5ex]
  Any term in the energy of a
  molecule that is quadratic, such as $\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2$ or
  $\frac{1}{2}k_\text{sp}x^2$ or $\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$, averages to
  $\frac{1}{2}k_BT$.}

This amazing result says that when some $10^{23}$ particles push and pull
and collide with each other, all the messy forces involved will result in
every quadratic energy term averaging to the same value.   It doesn't
matter if the molecule is heavier or lighter, or what the spring
constant is.  It also doesn't matter whether we are talking about
potential energy or translational kinetic energy or rotational kinetic
energy.  As long as the energy is quadratic in the dynamical variable, 
the thermal energy will depend only on $T$ and
Boltzmann's constant,
\begin{equation}
k_B= 1.38\times 10^{-23}\units{J/K},
\end{equation}
which is another constant of nature.  Notice how the units work out:
$k_BT$ is an energy.

%As an example, let's say that we have a gas composed of N non-interacting
%atoms (i.e., neglecting any forces between them), each of which 
%can move in the $x-$, $y-$ or $z-$directions.
%The energy of one of these atoms is then
%\begin{equation*}
%E_\text{atom} = 
%{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}mv_x^2 +
%{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}mv_y^2 +
%{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}mv_z^2.
%\end{equation*}
%(There are no potential energy terms here because we are neglecting
%interactions between the atoms.)
%According to the equipartition theorem, each of these three terms
%averages to ${\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_BT$, so the average energy
%per atom is
%\begin{equation*}
%\langle E_\text{atom}\rangle = 3\left({\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_BT\right) 
%= {\textstyle\frac{3}{2}}k_BT.
%\end{equation*}
%and the total thermal energy for the system is simply
%\begin{equation*}
%E_\text{therm,gas} = N ({\textstyle\frac{3}{2}}k_B T)
%\label{eq:E_thermalgas}
%\end{equation*}
%Note how quick this result is.  We don't have to worry about any of
%the details of the individual atoms in the gas.  The equipartition
%theorem takes care of all of that for us.

In the next sections, we'll use the equipartition theorem to analyze
thermal energy of an ideal solid.

\section{Ideal Solid Specific Heat}

To determine the molar specific heat of an ideal solid,
let us make the approximation that the neighbors of
a particular molecule remain fixed.  This turns out to be a reasonable
approximation for most solids.  Then the energy describing that
particular molecule is
\begin{equation}
E_\text{molecule} = {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}mv_x^2 +
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}mv_y^2 + {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}mv_z^2 +
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_\text{sp}x^2 + {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_{\rm sp}y^2 +
{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_\text{sp}z^2.
\label{eq:ball-spring_energy}
\end{equation}
There are six terms contributing to the energy, all of which are
quadratic.  Each term is fluctuating up and down as the molecule
interacts with its neighbors.  The equipartition theorem tell us,
then, that the average energy of this ball over time will be
\begin{equation}
\langle E_\text{molecule}\rangle =
6\left({\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}k_BT\right) = 3k_BT.
\end{equation}
Now consider an $N$ molecule ideal solid.  The number of moles
is given by $n = N/N_A$, and the 
thermal energy will be
\begin{equation}
E_\text{therm} = N (3 k_B T) = \frac{N}{N_A}(3k_BN_A)T = n3RT,
\quad\text{(ideal solid)}
\label{eq:E_thermal}
\end{equation}
where $R=N_A k_B = 8.31\units{J/mol$\cdot$K}$ is called the gas
constant, although it has nothing in particular to do with
gases.\footnote{This isn't our fault either.}  

Comparing Eqs.~(\ref{eq:E_thermal}) and (\ref{eq:Ethermspecificheat}),
the molar specific heat of the ideal solid is
\begin{equation}
C = 3R = 24.9\units{J/mol$\cdot$K} \qquad\text{(ideal solid)}
\end{equation}
regardless of the material.  This relation is known as the
Dulong-Petit law.  The molar specific heats of most solids agree with
the Dulong-Petit result to within a few percent accuracy.  For
example, the molar specific heat of copper is $C_\text{Cu} =
24.4\units{J/mol$\cdot$K}$, and comparable values for a variety of
other solids are given in Table~\ref{table:material_properties}.  This
provides more evidence that the ball-spring model of the ideal solid
is reasonable.

\label{table:material_properties}
\end{table}

Finally, note that the specific heat is only defined in terms of
$\Delta E_\text{therm}$ and $\Delta T$; it relates {\it changes} in
the temperature to changes in thermal energy.  However, if we assume
that the specific heat is independent of temperature, which is a
reasonable approximation down to some low temperature, then we can
also estimate
\begin{equation}
E_\text{therm} \approx nCT = n3RT. \qquad\text{(ideal solid)}
\end{equation}


\section{Heat and the First Law of Thermodynamics}
\label{section:heat}

There are many ways to add thermal energy to an object or to remove it
from the object.  We have already discussed how friction can increase
the thermal energy of a blow dart as it slides across the floor.
Another way to change the thermal energy is to bring the object into
{\it thermal contact} with something hotter or colder.  For a pair of
solid objects, thermal contact occurs when they are physically in
contact.  Then the molecules at the boundary exert forces on each
other and energy is transferred from the object with the higher
temperature to the object with the lower temperature.  
As we have already discussed,  temperature directs the flow of
thermal energy, determining which objects will spontaneously give off
energy and which objects will receive it.

The energy transferred spontaneously by molecular motion is given the
name {\it heat.}  Similar to work, heat is an energy transfer and not
an energy.  Think of thermal energy as a bank balance and heat and work
as deposits and withdrawals.  The distinction between heat and
work is the mechanism for the energy transfer.

\boxittext{Heat is the thermal energy transferred spontaneously due
to a temperature difference.}

\noindent All other forms of energy transfer into a system are lumped 
together as thermodynamic ``work."  For example, the term work can refer 
to energy transfer due to external forces that act on system (but do not 
change the motion of the center of mass of the system)\footnote{In Unit 1 
in this course we discussed the work done on a single particle,
and the resulting change in the kinetic energy of the particle.
In thermodynamics we are interested in composite systems, such as gases
liquids, and solids.  In composite systems, work can result in changes in
thermal energy as well as kinetic energy. In the thermodynamic systems
we study, there will be no changes in the bulk kinetic energy 
$K_\text{mech}$.}, but it also 
encompasses energy transfers due to other things, such as the warming of 
a piece of frozen broccoli in a microwave oven.  To distinguish the 
two forms of energy transfer, it is common to use the symbol $Q$ for heat, 
and $W$ for work.

Now we can state the first law of thermodynamics, which is simply a
statement of energy conservation: the change in thermal energy is
equal to how much work is done on the system plus how much heat flows
into the system:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_\text{therm} = Q + W \qquad\text{(1st Law of Thermodynamics)}
\end{equation}
Note that $Q$, like $W$, can be positive or negative, depending on
whether heat is flowing in or out.  The convention used here is to
define the heat $Q$ as being positive if heat is flowing {\em into}
the material (and negative if heat is flowing out), and to define
the work $W$ as the work done {\em on} the system.  Some people find it
convenient to write the first law with these conventions stated
explicitly:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_\text{therm} = Q_\text{in} + W_\text{on} \qquad\text{(1st Law of Thermodynamics)}
\label{eq:firstlaw}
\end{equation}

From our perspective today, with energy conservation a fundamental
principle, the 1st law may seem to be pretty obvious.  But historically it was a
very significant discovery, showing that indeed heat was just an
energy transfer, rather than some new substance.\footnote{Early theories of
thermodynamics proposed -- incorrectly -- that heat was some sort of
fluid (called {\em caloric}) that flows between hot and cold materials.
We now know, of course, that heat is simply the ``flow'' of energy.}
And the
importance of the first law cannot be overstated -- this seemingly simple
result forms the foundation of much of what we will be doing during
the next couple of weeks.

It is worth appreciating what is not heat.  Rubbing your hands
together when they are cold certainly does increase their thermal
energy, but not due to heat.  There is not a higher temperature object
making energy flow into your hands spontaneously, so there is no heat
flow.  Rather, you are doing work with your muscles, and the friction
force between your hands converts the mechanical energy of your moving
hands into thermal energy.

\begin{example}{First law}
You hold a $35\units{mol}$ iron anvil in place on a moving conveyor belt
so that the belt slides under the stationary anvil. The belt does 
$12,000\units{J}$ of work on the anvil, and and it gets warmer. During 
this process, the anvil loses $7,000\units{J}$ to the cooler surrounding air 
and to the belt.  If the anvil had an initial temperature of 
$22.0^{\circ}\units{C}$, what is its temperature at the end of this 
process?

\solution
First, we can use the first law to determine the change in the anvil's
thermal energy.  Conceptually, $12,000\units{J}$ is  added in the form
of work and $7,000\units{J}$ is removed in the form of a heat flow.  In terms
of Eq.~(\ref{eq:firstlaw}), $W_\text{on}=12000\units{J}$ and 
$Q_\text{in}=-7000\units{J}$ (negative since heat is flowing {\em out}
of the anvil).  So,
\begin{equation*}
\Delta E_\text{therm} = Q_\text{in} + W_\text{on} 
     = -7000\units{J} + 12000\units{J}= 5000\units{J}.
\end{equation*}
We can now use Eq.~(\ref{eq:Ethermspecificheat}) and the molar specific
heat of iron (see Table~\ref{table:material_properties} to find the
temperature change of the iron anvil:  
\begin{equation*}
\Delta E_\text{therm} = n C \Delta T.
\end{equation*}
Solving for the rise in temperature gives
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta T &=& \frac{\Delta E_\text{therm}}{nC} \\
         &=& \frac{5000\units{J}}{35\units{mol} \times 25.1\frac{\units{J}}
{\units{mol} \cdot \units{K}}} \\
         &=& 5.7\units{K}
\end{eqnarray*}  
The final temperature is therefore $22.0^\circ\units{C} + 5.7^\circ\units{C} = 
27.7^\circ\units{C}$.


Note that we could get a very good approximation of the result here by using
the ideal solid approximation for the molar
specific heat.

\end{example}


When a pair of objects is in thermal contact but is otherwise thermally
isolated, we can say that $\Delta E_\text{therm}$ is equal and opposite
for the two objects, since the thermal energy lost by the hotter object
is gained by the colder object.  This brings the objects closer together
in temperature, until finally they have the same temperature and no more
heat flows.  This situation is called {\it thermal equilibrium}.

\begin{example}{Hot Meets Cold}
One mole of an ideal solid at temperature $70^\circ\units{C}$ is
brought into thermal contact with two moles of an ideal solid at
temperature $10^\circ\units{C}$.  How much heat will flow out of the
hotter object before thermal equilibrium is reached?
 
\solution 
We will need to
determine the final equilibrium temperature, $T_f$.  
This is done by balancing the heat flows in and out:
\begin{equation} 
\Delta
E_\text{therm,1} = -\Delta E_\text{therm,2} 
\>\Rightarrow\>
n_1 C_1 \underbrace{(T_f - T_{1,i})}_{\Delta T_1} = -n_2 C_2 
\underbrace{(T_f - T_{2,i}) }_{\Delta T_2}
\label{eq:calorimetry}
\end{equation}
where $T_{1,i}$ and $T_{2,i}$ are the initial temperatures of objects
1 and 2.  Putting in values:
\begin{equation}
(1\units{mol})(3R)(T_f - 70^\circ\units{C})
 = -(2\units{mol})(3R)(T_f - 10^\circ\units{C})
\end{equation}
Note that we have used Celsius temperature.  This is because $\Delta
T$ is the same whether measured in Kelvin or Celsius (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:temperature_scales}).  Now we solve:
\begin{equation}
T_f - 70 = -2(T_f-10)\quad\Rightarrow\quad 3T_f = 70+20
\end{equation}
so
\begin{equation}
T_f = \frac{90}{3} = 30^\circ\units{C}.
\end{equation}
To complete the calculation, we go back to the change in thermal energy,
Eq.~(\ref{eq:calorimetry}),
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_\text{therm,1} = (1\units{mol})(24.9\units{J/mol$\cdot$K})
(30^\circ\units{C} - 70^\circ\units{C}) = -996\units{J}.
\end{equation}
So $996\units{J}$ of heat flowed out of object $1$ and into object $2$.
\end{example}
